Explain the purpose of your website.
The website’s purpose is to transition from brick-and-mortar to ECOM for Chic Apparel, which specializes in trendy and stylish clothing for women. The website’s purpose is to also serve as an online presence for a small business, providing basic information about the business and its offerings to potential customers. The website includes a header with the business name and logo, a navigation bar to help visitors easily access different sections of the website, a main section with information about the business and its products/services, and a footer with contact information and links to social media accounts.

Explain the challenges and limitations you faced while creating the website in GitHub Pages.
The only challenge I encountered was figuring out that I needed to install git on my Windows to enable me to use my favorite code editor (visual studio code) to push files to my repository.

What steps did you take to overcome the challenges and limitations?
I installed the latest version of git and then restarted my system, and I it worked perfectly as expected.
